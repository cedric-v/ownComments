# Automated Email Response & Save Email as PDF

This repository contains two Google Apps Script files:

- [`autoResponseMailsBasedOnKeywordsGoogleAppsScript.js`](autoResponseMailsBasedOnKeywordsGoogleAppsScript.js): Automatically replies to unread Gmail messages based on detected keywords (placeholders provided) and applies labels.
- [`saveEmailAsPDF.js`](saveEmailAsPDF.js): Saves emails and PDF attachments from Gmail to Google Drive, applies labels, and archives processed emails.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Copy scripts to the Google Apps Script editor** attached to your Gmail account.
2. **Configure labels and folder IDs** as needed:
   - Update `labelSource`, `labelProcessed`, and `folderId` in [`saveEmailAsPDF.js`](saveEmailAsPDF.js).
   - Update `keywordsSet1`, `keywordsSet2`, and response placeholders in [`autoResponseMailsBasedOnKeywordsGoogleAppsScript.js`](autoResponseMailsBasedOnKeywordsGoogleAppsScript.js).
   - Ensure labels used in both scripts exist or are created by the script.
3. **Set up time-based triggers** in Apps Script:
   - For the automatic keyword-based reply script, configure a time-driven trigger to run every minute for near real-time responses.
   - For the email-to-PDF script, set the trigger to run every 12 hours or as needed.
4. **Review and adapt reply templates and keywords** for your organization.

## Permissions

These scripts require access to Gmail and Google Drive. When deploying, review and accept the necessary permissions.

## Security Notice

- Do not publish personal credentials or sensitive information.
- Review reply templates and keywords before publishing.
